Installation is pretty simple.

It can be done by running install.sh (once chmod +x'ed).

That will compile and install dwm, st, and slstatus, as well as putting a xinitrc in your home directory for startx and an xbindkeysrc. If you wish to use my fish config put the fish folder into your .config.

Dependencies:

xbindkeys

fish (if you wish to use my fish config)

dmenu
